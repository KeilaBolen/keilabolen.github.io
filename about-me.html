  My professional experience and qualifications are listed in my
  resume, however I am and can do so much more than what a few pages
  can tell you. I am organized, detail oriented, focused, and driven
  to succeed. When given the opportunity to learn new things, I do
  so quickly and with great enthusiasm. I do not shy away from a
  challenging work environment, as that is where I thrive. I have
  the ability to think outside the box and can bring a fresh
  perspective when others face obstacles.​

<p>
  I am also a Writer, Photographer, Entrepreneur, and Co-Founder of
  humorouslysad.com.​

<p>
  I currently have several blogs I have begun working on, and have
  started honing my skills in web design as well as learning to
  write code. All are still works in progress, but I am determined,
  and find the challenge both motivating and stimulating.​
